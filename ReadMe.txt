The code in this repository was used for a university project where we had to use a C++ engine to create a hover car racer.
The following functionality was implemented by me: 

- Collision
- Ship Movement
- Natural Deceleration of ship
- 3D Vectors
- UI Output
- VSync 
- Load and Unloading models efficiently
- Changing Camera Placement and Types
- Lap Timers
- Checkpoints
- Map Layout
- Pause Game
- Start Game Countdown


Things I would have liked to add: 
- Use of Momentum to move the ship, allows for drifting etc...
- Use of a ghost ship that takes the stored location of the player ship on their best lap
- AI enemies
- Saving and Loading of lap times
- More realistic collision
